# MyLittleFarmVR
 
This project aims to create a Virtual Reality (VR) farming simulation game using the Unity game engine. The game, titled "My Little Farm VR," offers players an immersive and engaging experience in the world of agriculture. Players will have the opportunity to cultivate their virtual farms, from purchasing seeds and tilling the land to harvesting crops and managing their farms for profit. The game will feature a charming and cozy low-poly art style to create a welcoming environment. While the core gameplay will focus on farming, additional features, such as farm animals and mini-games, may be added to enhance the player's experience.

For project management and organization, this project will utilize Miro for mood boarding and brainstorming ideas, as well as Trello for task management and tracking progress. The development process will be divided into phases, with an initial focus on VR functionalities, followed by gameplay development and, finally, a visual and audio polish.
